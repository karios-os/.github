**KariosOS** is an open-source **Infrastructure Operating System (IaOS)** designed for building and operating modern private clouds, edge environments, and enterprise datacenters.

KariosOS unifies virtualization, storage, networking, IP address management, Kubernetes orchestration, DNS/DHCP services, observability, and automation into a single platform with a common API and management experience.

Instead of assembling and maintaining dozens of disconnected infrastructure products, operators can manage their entire environment through a unified control plane.

---

## Why KariosOS?

### Infrastructure as an Operating System

KariosOS treats infrastructure as a single operating system rather than a collection of independent tools.

Compute, storage, networking, security, observability, and automation operate through a common platform, simplifying deployment and day-to-day operations.

### Enterprise Virtualization with bhyve

KariosOS is built around the native **bhyve hypervisor**, providing lightweight, high-performance virtualization for modern workloads.

Capabilities include:

- Virtual Machines
- Templates & Cloning
- Snapshots
- Resource Management
- API-Driven Provisioning
- Multi-Node Infrastructure Management

### ZFS-Native Storage

Storage is integrated directly into the platform through **ZFS**, enabling:

- Snapshots
- Replication
- Data Integrity
- Storage Pool Management
- Automated Provisioning

### Unified Operations

Manage infrastructure from a single platform:

- Virtual Machines
- Containers & Kubernetes
- Networking
- IP Address Management
- DNS & DHCP
- Storage
- Monitoring
- Datacenter Inventory

### API First

Every capability exposed through the user interface is available through APIs and automation workflows.

### Open Source

KariosOS Community Edition is developed openly and welcomes community participation.
